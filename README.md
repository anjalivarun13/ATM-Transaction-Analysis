# 🏧 ATM Transaction Dashboard – Power BI Project

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is a **Power BI Dashboard** designed to analyze ATM operations across multiple states in India. It provides deep insights into **transaction volumes, revenue performance, cost breakdowns, and uptime metrics**, helping stakeholders monitor financial health and operational efficiency of ATM networks.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- To track and compare **financial and non-financial transactions** across time periods.  
- To analyze **revenue performance by state and ATM type**.  
- To monitor **cost components** like maintenance, AMC, and spare replacements.  
- To evaluate **gross profit margins, uptime, and EBILL averages** for strategic decisions.

## 🚩 Business Problem  
ATM networks involve complex operations with multiple cost centers and performance metrics. Without a centralized dashboard:  
- Financial teams struggle to **track profitability and cost efficiency**.  
- Operations teams lack visibility into **uptime and maintenance trends**.  
- Decision-makers cannot easily **compare performance across regions or ATM types**.

## ✅ How the Dashboard Solves This  
The Power BI dashboard addresses these challenges by:  
- Visualizing **cost breakdowns** across CRA, AMC, UPS, and site maintenance.  
- Providing **state-wise revenue and transaction analysis** for better regional planning.  
- Highlighting **gross profit %, uptime, and EBILL** to assess ATM health.  
- Enabling **interactive filtering by month and ATM type** for granular insights.

This transforms raw ATM data into **actionable intelligence** for finance, operations, and strategy teams.

## ⚡ Features  
- 📌 **KPIs at a glance:** Total cost, average monthly transactions, revenue, uptime, EBILL, and gross profit %.  
- 📊 **Cost Analysis:** Donut charts for CRA, AMC, UPS, and site maintenance.  
- 📈 **Revenue Breakdown:** Bar chart comparing MHA, monthly, and total ATM revenue by state.  
- 📉 **Transaction Trends:** Financial vs non-financial transactions over time.  
- 📍 **Detail Analysis:** State-wise metrics segmented by revenue performance ranges.  
- 🎛 **Interactivity:** Filters for month and ATM type (Captive, DBT Site, Regular, Tea Estate).

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Power BI** → Dashboard creation & visualization  
- **Excel/CSV Dataset** → ATM transaction and cost data  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation** → Power Query in Power BI  
- **Visualization Techniques** → Donut charts, bar charts, line charts, matrix tables, and card visuals
